[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/bccampus/tlpd.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.com/bccampus/tlpd)

#### About ####
The Teaching Learning Professional Development (TLPD) web portal is an initiative developed by BCcampus with the B.C. post-secondary educator community. 
The web portal aims to support post-secondary educators in promoting and finding teaching and learning professional development opportunities and support the building of community connections.

#### Installation ####
This is a child theme of [CBox Theme](https://github.com/cuny-academic-commons/cbox-theme) which is the default theme for the plugin [Commons in a Box](https://github.com/cuny-academic-commons/commons-in-a-box) which is "a 
suite of WordPress and BuddyPress plugins and themes for community communication and collaboration, put into a single package that  is easy to install, customize and maintain."

- install the plugin 'Commons in a Box'
- install the plugin [Events Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/events-manager/)
- activate the bundled theme 'CBox Theme' which comes as part of `Commons in a Box`
- activate this child theme 'Teaching and Learning Professional Development'
- install dependencies via the `composer install` command in your terminal

#### Purpose ####
The main purpose of the child theme is to tie the locations of events generated from `Events Manager` to a map using Google API. 
Map functions include displaying location pins, clustering, searching, and filtering.  
A secondary purpose is to contain all customizations in the child theme and still benefit from parent theme updates.
